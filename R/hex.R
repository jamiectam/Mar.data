#' @description This is a mesh of hexagonal grid cells covering much the Northwest Atlantic.
#' The individual hexagons each have an area of 0.0011111 decimal degrees2
#' (the same area as a 2min x 2min square grid cell). The hexes extend into the
#' coastline somewhat, with a northern boundary of ~61 2', a southern boundary
#' of ~35N 0'. The eastern boundary follows the NAFO divisions boundaries of 6H,
#' 3M, 3K, 2G, 2H and 2J.
